AirBnB Clone - MySQL
Project Description
This project is a continuation of the previous AirBnB Clone project, developed for ALX Africa as part of its software engineering program. In this iteration we use MySQL database as a storage engine and provides new functionalities like console improvements, database setup scripts, and the transition from file storage to database storage.

Features
Bug-free and extensive test cases using unittest module.
Console improvements allowing object creation with given parameters.
MySQL setup development and test scripts.
Delete object functionality to delete obj from __objects if itâ€™s inside.
DBStorage using SQLAlchemy, with the transition from file storage to database storage.
The ability to filter and search for objects using various parameters.
Usage
Clone the repository


Install MySQL database

Run the MySQL setup scripts to create the required databases and users

./setup_mysql_dev.sql to prepare a MySQL server for the project in development mode

./setup_mysql_test.sql to prepare a MySQL server for the project in test mode

Run the console to interact with the application

./console.py
